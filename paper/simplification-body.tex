\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\todo[inline]{Motivation and overview.}

Things we need to do somewhere in this paper:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Convince everyone that this is awesome. It would be particularly cool if we can somehow make the case that these ideas are relevant even if people aren't doing stack based work. Can we do that, though? Most (i.e., tree-based)
	GP systems don't allow for things like silencing of nodes or replacing nodes
	with NOOPs because it typically wouldn't be clear how to interpret such a tree.
	\item Cover relevant work. This might require some digging? I bet we cite~\cite{Helmuth:2015:dissertation}, though.
	\item Cover relevant background. This is going to (at least) require explaining PLUSH genomes, the conversion from PLUSH to PUSH, the evaluation of PUSH programs (so we can understand what NOOPs do), and silent genes.
	\item Describe the 5 simplification methods
	\item Experimental setup
	\item Results
	\item Discussion
	\item Future work
	\item Conclude
\end{itemize}

Smaller solutions have other benefits as well: understandability, faster runtimes, etc. But, we won't concentrate on those in this paper.

\section{Automatic Simplification in Push}
\label{sec:simplification}

Automatic simplification was introduced to Push as a tool for making evolved programs easier to understand. While it can be applied to any program, it has typically been used post-run to make solution programs easier to understand without changing their behavior \cite{Spector:2014:GECCOcomp}. It has also been used as a bloat-control genetic operator during genetic programming runs, with mixed success \cite{Zhan:2014:GECCOcomp}.

Automatic simplification is a simple hill-climbing algorithm that tries to make an individual's program smaller without changing the program's behavior on the training cases. At each step, we first make small changes to the program to make it smaller. We then check whether the smaller program produces the same error vector as the original program. If so, we continue with the new program; otherwise, we reverts to the previous program. This process repeats for a set number of simplification steps, and then returns the resulting simplified program. The algorithm is presented in detail in Algorithm \ref{alg:simplification}.

\ErrorVector $\leftarrow$ \ComputeErrors{\Ind} \;
\For{\S $\leftarrow 0$ \KwTo \Steps}{

	\NewInd $\leftarrow$ \TakeStep{\Ind} \;
	\NewErrorVector $\leftarrow$ \ComputeErrors{\NewInd} \;
	\If{\NewErrorVector $=$ \ErrorVector}{
		\Ind $\leftarrow$ \NewInd
	}
}
\Return \Ind
\end{algorithm}

In this paper we explore five different variations of automatic simplification. Each variation follows the same general algorithm; they only differ in the particular steps taken to make programs smaller. %The five variations are listed in Table ???, along with a description of what they do at each simplification step.
Below is a description of each variation:



Types of automatic simplification (EXPLAIN THESE): program, genome, genome-backtracking, genome-noop, genome-backtracking-noop.

\item
Differentiate between our work and algebraic simplification (as used in semantic GP), since this CAN change the semantics on inputs not in the training set, where algebraic methods cannot. Also, algebraic methods wouldn't work on general programs that we're evolving
