\todo[inline]{Motivation and overview.}

Things we need to do somewhere in this paper:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Convince everyone that this is awesome. It would be particularly cool if we can somehow make the case that these ideas are relevant even if people aren't doing stack based work. Can we do that, though? Most (i.e., tree-based)
	GP systems don't allow for things like silencing of nodes or replacing nodes
	with NOOPs because it typically wouldn't be clear how to interpret such a tree.
	\item Cover relevant work. This might require some digging? I bet we cite~\cite{Helmuth:2015:dissertation}, though.
	\item Cover relevant background. This is going to (at least) require explaining PLUSH genomes, the conversion from PLUSH to PUSH, the evaluation of PUSH programs (so we can understand what NOOPs do), and silent genes.
	\item Describe the 5 simplification methods
	\item Experimental setup
	\item Results
	\item Discussion
	\item Future work
	\item Conclude
\end{itemize}

Smaller solutions have other benefits as well: understandability, faster runtimes, etc. But, we won't concentrate on those in this paper.

\section{Automatic Simplification in Push}
\label{sec:simplification}

Automatic simplification was introduced to Push as a tool for making evolved programs easier to understand \cite{Robinson:2001:GPtieus, spector:2002:GPEM}. While it can be applied to any program, it has typically been used post-run to make solution programs easier to understand without changing their behavior \cite{Spector:2014:GECCOcomp}. It has also been used as a bloat-control genetic operator during genetic programming runs, with mixed success \cite{Zhan:2014:GECCOcomp}. \todo[inline]{Might make more sense to move the above paragraph to the intro?}

Automatic simplification is a simple hill-climbing algorithm that tries to make an individual's program smaller without changing the program's behavior on the training cases. At each step, we first make small changes to the program to make it smaller. We then check whether the smaller program produces the same error vector as the original program. If so, we continue with the new program; otherwise, we reverts to the previous program. This process repeats for a set number of simplification steps, and then returns the resulting simplified program. The algorithm is presented in detail in Algorithm \ref{alg:simplification}.

}
\Return \Ind
\end{algorithm}

In this paper we explore five different methods of automatic simplification. Each method follows the same general algorithm; they only differ in the particular steps taken to make programs smaller. %The five methods are listed in Table ???, along with a description of what they do at each simplification step.
Below is a description of each method:

\textbf{Program} simplification, which has been used in Push since its inception \cite{Robinson:2001:GPtieus}, acts on an individual's Push program, as opposed to its linear Plush genome. At each simplification step, it has an 80\% chance of removing one or two random "code points" from the program, where a \textit{code point} is an instruction, a constant, or a parenthesized block of code. The other 20\% of the time it randomly removes one set of parentheses from a code block in the program, flattening the code inside the parentheses into the level that the code block occupied.

The other four simplification methods act on an individual's linear Plush genome prior to its translation into a Push program. There are three basic steps that are used across these genome methods: silencing random genes, unsilencing random genes, and nooping random genes. Silencing a gene activates its "silent" epigenetic marker, making that instruction not appear the resulting Push program, as well as not ending any open parenthesized code blocks. When picking a random gene to silence, we never select a gene that is already silent.

In some methods we silence some genes while unsilencing others, which makes it possible to backtrack by activating genes that were previously turned off. We hope that the backtracking enabled by unsilencing will allow simplification to escape some local program size minima that it might otherwise be impossible to escape, resulting in more reliable simplification to smaller programs. Similar to silencing, we never select an unsilenced gene to unsilence. Note that we silence genes instead of removing them entirely because it makes it possible to backtrack progress by unsilencing genes.

Finally, some methods "noop" genes by replacing their instructions with instructions that have no effect when executed. Some Push programs require some instruction to be present in a location, but it does not matter what the instruction is as long as it doesn't manipulate certain stacks. We can replace these instructions with noops, potentially making the program more general without actually making it smaller. Genes that are already nooped cannot be selected by a noop step of simplification.

		       & Noop 2 & 0.10 \\

	\end{tabu}
\end{table}

The four genome methods of simplification are listed in Table \ref{table:genome-methods}. Each variant lists the types of steps that can be taken and the probability of each step being chosen. The most basic of the methods, \textbf{Genome} only allows for the silencing of 1 to 4 random genes in a single step. \textbf{Genome-Backtracking} and \textbf{Genome-Backtracking-Noop} occasionally unsilence a silent gene while silencing another, allowing the process to not follow a strict hill-climbing scheme.  \textbf{Genome-Noop} and Genome-Backtracking-Noop use nooping to turn intructions into noops without removing them entirely.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\todo[inline]{Talk about what the results mean}

Here are some potentially interesting questions to explore with this data:

    Which simplification method tends to result in the smallest programs on average? Is there any significant differences here?

    Is getting smaller during simplification important for generalization? In other words, do smaller programs post-simplification tend to generalize better than larger ones?

        Note: we could ask this question of all the simplified programs, but we could also concentrate only on runs that had some generalizing programs and some non-generalizing programs, which might give us a more detailed view. It would probably be worthwhile to look into both of these. I'm not sure exactly how we would investigate this. @mcphee made some cool graphs last year that start answering this question. I've included one at the bottom of this post that was made with limited data; a similar graph for the full data might be a good place to start.

    It might be worthwhile to break this big plot into smaller plots, grouping together similar plots. For example, we might group plots based on how often unsimplified programs generalize -- groups of something like 0-50\%, 50-95\%, and 95-100\% generalization. Or, we could do it some other way. But, this could definitely help with spotting differences based on problem.

    Would a multi-restart simplification get us to smaller programs more often than the other methods we've tried? This could potentially avoid unlucky local minima. The backtracking methods are also trying to avoid unlucky local minima, so this would be an interesting comparison. It seems like we could answer this question with the data we have.

\subsection{Nic's Thoughts on Unused Push Instructions}
Anyway, I wouldn't recommend using the word "bloat" because I also think that is generally associated with a tendency to get bigger and bigger and bigger in ways that aren't connected to improvements in fitness, and that doesn't seem to be a Clojush thing. (I'm personally not super clear on why that's not a thing in Clojush, etc., etc., but that's not today's problem.)

Even more complicated is the fact that in Push programs we often find various categories of "unused" code. There are instructions that do nothing because their arguments aren't on the stack, or sometimes aren't on the stack. There are instructions that do something, but no one cares (they push a boolean that's never used). There are instructions that are there just to add content to a stack, but who's particular action doesn't matter. Etc., etc. These are not things "standard tree-based GP" people run into very often, and might not be obvious to them.

Lastly, it can be really hard to tell what's being used and how in complex programs, and how that relates to the simplified versions. It's easy to implicitly assume that the simplified program is "the thing", and that everything that got removed didn't really matter in the original execution. (This is often an assumption in tree-based bloat discussions.) I'm pretty sure this is often very not true, however, in Push, and that's important to the generalization. It seems fairly common, for example, for Push programs (especially with the "standard" instruction set) to have a lot of unnecessary looping that frequently gets removed or reduced in simplification. Often that looping is actually executed in the original program, so it's part of how the training answers are formed. I have a suspicion that part of why simplification often improves generalization is that it removes these unnecessary loops that are sometimes fragile and do weird things on certain inputs.
