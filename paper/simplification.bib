	uncompromising problems, characterised by the
	requirement that solutions must perform optimally on
	each of many test cases. Many of the problems that have
	long motivated genetic programming research, including
	the automation of many traditional programming tasks,
	are uncompromising. We describe and analyse the
	recently proposed lexicase parent selection algorition
	and show that it can facilitate the solution of
	uncompromising problems by genetic programming. Unlike
	most traditional parent selection techniques, lexicase
	selection does not base selection on a fitness value
	that is aggregated over all test cases; rather, it
	considers test cases one at a time in random order. We
	present results comparing lexicase selection to more
	traditional parent selection methods, including
	standard tournament selection and implicit fitness
	sharing, on four uncompromising problems: finding terms
	in finite algebras, designing digital multipliers,
	counting words in files, and performing symbolic
	regression of the factorial function. We provide
	evidence that lexicase selection maintains higher
	levels of population diversity than other selection
	methods, which may partially explain its utility as a
	parent selection algorithm in the context of
	uncompromising problems.",

	abstract =	"A recent article on benchmark problems for genetic
	programming suggested that researchers focus attention
	on the digital multiplier problem, also known as the
	multiple output multiplier problem, in part because it
	is scalable and in part because the requirement of
	multiple outputs presents challenges for some forms of
	genetic programming [20]. Here we demonstrate the
	application of stack-based genetic programming to the
	digital multiplier problem using the PushGP genetic
	programming system, which evolves programs expressed in
	the stack-based Push programming language. We
	demonstrate the use of output instructions and argue
	that they provide a natural mechanism for producing
	multiple outputs in a stack-based genetic programming
	context. We also show how two recent developments in
	PushGP dramatically improve the performance of the
	system on the digital multiplier problem. These
	developments are the ULTRA genetic operator, which
	produces offspring via Uniform Linear Transformation
	with Repair and Alternation [12], and lexicase
	selection, which selects parents according to
	performance on cases considered sequentially in random
	order [11]. Our results using these techniques show not
	only their utility, but also the utility of the digital
	multiplier problem as a benchmark problem for genetic
	programming research. The results also demonstrate the
	exibility of stack-based genetic programming for
	solving problems with multiple outputs and for serving

	abstract =	"Several genetic programming researchers have argued
	for the utility of genetic operators that act
	uniformly. By act uniformly we mean two specific
	things: that the probability of an inherited program
	component being modified during inheritance is
	independent of the size and shape of the parent
	programs beyond the component in question; and that
	pairs of parents are combined in ways that allow
	arbitrary combinations of components from each parent
	to appear in the child. Uniform operators described in
	previous work have had limited utility, however,
	because of a mismatch between the relevant notions of
	uniformity and the hierarchical structure and variable
	sizes of many genetic programming representations. In
	this chapter we describe a new genetic operator, ULTRA,
	which incorporates aspects of both mutation and
	crossover and acts approximately uniformly across
	programs of variable sizes and structures. ULTRA treats
	hierarchical programs as linear sequences and includes
	a repair step to ensure that syntax constraints are
	satisfied after variation. We show that on the drug
	bioavailability and Pagie-1 benchmark problems ULTRA
	produces significant improvements both in
	problem-solving power and in program size relative to
	standard operators. Experiments with factorial
	regression and with the Boolean 6-multiplexer problem
	demonstrate that ULTRA can manipulate programs that
	make use of hierarchical structure, but also that it is
	not always beneficial. The demonstrations evolve
	programs in the Push programming language, which makes
	repair particularly simple, but versions of the
	technique should be applicable in other genetic
	programming systems as well.",

	presents a new approach to solving modal problems with

		 In this ground-breaking book, John Koza shows how this
		 remarkable paradigm works and provides substantial
		 empirical evidence that solutions to a great variety of
		 problems from many different fields can be found by
		 genetically breeding populations of computer programs.
		 Genetic Programming contains a great many worked
		 examples and includes a sample computer code that will
		 allow readers to run their own programs. In getting
		 computers to solve problems without being explicitly
		 programmed, Koza stresses two points: that seemingly
		 different problems from a variety of fields can be
		 reformulated as problems of program induction, and that
		 the recently developed genetic programming paradigm
		 provides a way to search the space of possible computer
		 programs for a highly fit individual computer program
		 to solve the problems of program induction. Good
		 programs are found by evolving them in a computer
		 against a fitness measure instead of by sitting down
		 and writing them. John R. Koza is Consulting Associate
		 Professor in the Computer Science Department at
		 Stanford University. Endorsements The research reported
		 in this book is a tour de force. For the first time,
		 since the idea was bandied about in the 1940s and early
		 1950s, we have a non-trivial, nontailored set of

		 recently proposed form of Genetic Programming (GP) that
		 searches directly the space of the underlying semantics
		 of the programs. The fitness landscape seen by the GSGP
		 variation operators is unimodal with a linear slope by
		 construction and, consequently, easy to search. Despite
		 this advantage, the offspring produced by these
		 operators grow very quickly. A new implementation of
		 the same operators was proposed that computes the
		 semantics of the offspring without having to explicitly

		 GSGP presented a surprisingly good generalisation
		 ability, which was justified by some properties of the
		 geometric semantic operators. In this paper, we show
		 that the good generalization ability of GSGP was the
		 result of a small implementation deviation from the
		 original formulation of the mutation operator, and that
		 without it the generalization results would be
		 significantly worse. We explain the reason for this
		 difference, and then we propose two variants of the
		 geometric semantic mutation that deterministically and
		 optimally adapt the mutation step. They reveal to be
		 more efficient in learning the training data, and they
		 also achieve a competitive generalization in only a

		 The idea is based on a dynamic two-layered selection

		 the average dissimilarity to the repulsors as a
		 criterion to be maximized. Two kinds of

		 The representation allows for arbitrarily-ordered

		 well on cases not seen during the training phase. In
		 Genetic Programming generalization has recently been
		 recognised as an important open issue, and increased
		 efforts are being made towards evolving models that do
		 not overfit. In this work we expand on recent
		 developments that showed that using a small and
		 frequently changing subset of the training data is
		 effective in reducing over fitting and improving
		 generalisation. Particularly, we build upon the idea of
		 randomly choosing a single training instance at each
		 generation and balance it with periodically using all
		 training data. The motivation for this approach is
		 based on trying to keep overfitting low (represented by
		 using a single training instance) and still presenting
		 enough information so that a general pattern can be
		 found (represented by using all training data). We
		 propose two approaches called interleaved sampling and
		 random interleaved sampling that respectively represent
		 doing this balancing in a deterministic or a
		 probabilistic way. Experiments are conducted on three
		 high-dimensional real-life datasets on the
		 pharmacokinetics domain. Results show that most of the
		 variants of the proposed approaches are able to
		 consistently improve generalisation and reduce over
		 fitting when compared to standard Genetic Programming.
		 The best variants are even able of such improvements on
		 a dataset where a recent and representative
		 state-of-the-art method could not. Furthermore, the
		 resulting models are short and hence easier to
		 interpret, an important achievement from the
		 applications' point of view.",

		 Genetic Programming (GP) over unseen data by minimizing
		 the variance of the output values of evolving models
		 alongwith reducing error on the training data. Variance
		 is a well understood, simple and inexpensive
		 statistical measure; it is easy to integrate into a GP
		 implementation and can be computed over arbitrary input
		 values even when the target output is not known.
		 Moreover, we propose a simple variance based selection
		 scheme to decide between two models (individuals). The
		 scheme is simple because, although it uses bi-objective
		 criteria to differentiate between two competing models,
		 it does not rely on a multi-objective optimisation
		 algorithm. In fact, standard multi-objective algorithms
		 can also employ this scheme to identify good trade-offs
		 such as those located around the knee of the Pareto
		 Front. The results indicate that, despite some
		 limitations, these proposals significantly improve the
		 performance of GP over a selection of high dimensional
		 (multi-variate) problems from the domain of symbolic
		 regression. This improvement is manifested by superior
		 results over test sets in three out of four problems,
		 and by the fact that performance over the test sets
		 does not degrade as often witnessed with standard GP;
		 neither is this performance ever inferior to that on
		 the training set. As with some earlier studies, these
		 results do not find a link between expressions of small
		 sizes and their ability to generalise to unseen data.",
